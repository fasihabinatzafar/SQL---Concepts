**The Setup**
1. *Massive Log Table:* The data table in question, typically referred to as a "log table," is extensive, implying a high volume of data entries, potentially scaling to millions or billions of rows. Such tables often log events, transactions, or interactions over time, making them grow rapidly and continuously.
2. *Clustered Index on ID:* The table has a clustered index based on the ID field. A clustered index stores the data rows in the table sorted based on the indexed column(s). Since ID is sequential, newer entries have higher IDs and are placed at the end of the table. This setup is efficient for insert operations and queries filtered or sorted by ID.
3. *No Index on Date:* Despite Date also being a critical field for queries, particularly for time-based data retrieval, there is no dedicated index for this column. This absence can make any query filtered by Date less efficient, as the database engine must perform a full table scan or less optimized seeking behaviors to retrieve data based on date criteria.
